This template has additional css and html code to allow for centred links and additional boxes for image content or other more detailed content on a single landing page. The additional code achieves the following:

## New Html template

I have added some additional structure to the the original template of jolla-blue as this seemed to be the latest template to be added.

The key bits of the html can be divided in the head, body and footer of the single html document.

## New font

To add some different in the template I have used a new font that can be changed 

*and in the future this will be within the yaml content of future versions*

## Additional yaml content

There are now 3 additional yaml statements that are custom to this template:

We embed a `css` code chunk here.

```{css, echo=FALSE}
p {
  font-size: 32px;
}
```
